## 🧩 App Blocks (Logic)

The app's logic was built using Thunkable's drag-and-drop blocks. The logic includes:
* Initializing variables for the two numbers and the result.
* Updating the variables when the user types in the text boxes.
* Click-handlers for each of the four operation buttons.
* A "Clear all" button to reset the app.
